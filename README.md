***********************************************************
TO RUN:

-You do NOT need the .java file (the .java file contains the source code)

-You should be able to run the .jar file like a .exe if you have the latest version of java installed
***********************************************************

Although this software should be stable and run as intended I cannot offer any warranty
to the extent permitted by applicable law.  You're free to read the source code,
so if it crashes your computer, kills your cat or gives an incorrect answer that makes you lose
your credit fleet don't blame me, blame yourself.  Do send a bug report though.

If you notice a bug, or you have a suggestion for improvement, let me know.
This includes any instance where the software doesn't behave as you would expect/like it to,
for example a shortcut not working.

**v0.2 Changelog**

-Fixed rounding issues giving .999999999999, .0000000001 etc

-Fixed misleading labels

-Added keylister so you can now calculate by hitting enter

-Changed now new lines are written to avoid constantly having a blank line at the bottom of the results area

-Moved some label values to variables because I felt like it and to make translating very slightly easier


Still todo:

-Prevent user from entering multiple decimal points

-Have seperate labels for fields


Cannot easily fix:

-Fundamental issue with swing means window size is not displayed correctly in tiling WMs.  As far as I'm aware this affects literally no users but it's unfortunate.
