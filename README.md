Although this software should be stable and run as intended I cannot offer any warranty
to the extent permitted by applicable law.  You're free to read the source code,
so if it crashes your computer, kills your cat or gives an incorrect answer that makes you lose
your credit fleet don't blame me, blame yourself.  Do send a bug report though.

If you notice a bug, or you have a suggestion for improvement, let me know.
This includes any instance where the software doesn't behave as you would expect/like it to,
for example a shortcut not working.
